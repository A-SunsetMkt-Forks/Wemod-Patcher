<h4>WeMod patcher allows you to get some WeMod features absolutely free. This script patches WeMod, thereby removing the daily usage limit (2h), etc.</h4>

## 👾 No malware? Is it safe for me?

---

Yes, this is safe. This script is open-source, and you can check the code yourself. I have no intention of harming you or your computer. The script does absolutely nothing with your computer and does not require Internet access. It only affects WeMod files.

## 💻 Does this script only work with older versions of WeMod like other unlockers?

---

With this patch you will be able to use the latest version together with Pro. 

##  👀 What features will be available?

---

✅ Unlimited usage time <br/>
✅ No ads <br/>
✅ AI Game guides <br/>
✅ Saving mods <br/>
❌ Connect phone <br/>
❌ Hotkeys (hotkey functionality breaks after patch for unknown reason)
